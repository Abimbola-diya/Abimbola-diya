# Hi — I'm Abimbola Diya 👋  
Machine Learning & Python Backend Engineer building production-grade systems that solve real-world problems.

I design **reliable**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** backend services with:
- 🐍 Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask)
- 🧱 Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis)
- ☁️ Cloud & DevOps (AWS, Docker, CI/CD)
- 🧠 ML/AI Tooling (PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn)
- 🌐 Frontend Familiarity: TypeScript · React (for integrations & tooling)

## 🔭 Currently Shipping
**HydraLink** — an AI-powered environmental tool that detects plastic buildup in Lagos drainages and estimates value-to-recycling.  
→ Goal: reduce flooding by **up to 60%**, incentivize recycling, and build data-driven environmental governance.  
→ Backend is optimized for high-throughput image processing and low DB overhead.
